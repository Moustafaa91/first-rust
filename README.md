# First Rust Project

Welcome to my first Rust project!  
This repository serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with Rust. Here, I'll apply concepts and techniques as I explore the language.

## Purpose

- Practice Rust fundamentals
- Experiment with new features and libraries
- Document my learning journey

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Moustafaa91/first-rust
    cd first-rust
    ```
3. Build and run the project:
    ```sh
    cargo run
    ```

## Notes

- This project is for learning purposes.
- Code may change frequently as I try new things.
